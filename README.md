This is small MS-DOS multotasker, written during 1992-1995 when we run
first BBS and Fido node in Odesa, Ukraine, on very weak IBM-PC XT, and
later on IBM-PC AT machines.

It features preemptive multitasking, some inter-process communication
primitives, prioritized scheduling with round robin planning on each level
of priority.

We had to run on the same computer: BBS, a program for dialing uplink for
mail, a program for processing, rerouting and packing mail. At that time,
we were very limited in RAM, so we needed a very thin layer to provide
multitasking.
